    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I'm a PhD candidate in Philosophy, at the University of Cambridge, supervised by Professor Clare Chambers and Dr Jessie Munton. I am funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (OOC DTP), and by Christ's College, Cambridge, where I hold a Levy Plumb Doctoral Studentship.</p>
    <p>Before my PhD, I studied Mathematics and Philosophy at Merton College, Oxford, then completed an MPhil in Philosophy at Darwin College, Cambridge, funded by the Cambridge Trust.</p>
    <p>My doctoral research combines philosophy of medicine with social and political philosophy. I'm interested in what it means to have a gender identity, over and above just having a gender. What do we mean when we say that we identify as, or with, some gender, and what is the psychological and political significance of a gender identity? What kinds of rights and duties, if any, might a gender identity give rise to? For my PhD, I have developed a novel account of gender identities as interpretative frameworks. I'm also interested in how we medicalise (and pathologise) gender identities. Is the gender dysphoria diagnosis a sound diagnosis? If not, why not? More generally, what is it that we look for in psychiatric diagnoses? In my PhD, I develop an account of the standards against which psychiatric diagnoses should be evaluated, and apply them to critically appraise the gender dysphoria diagnosis.</p>
    <p>Alongside my research, I teach a wide variety of undergraduate Philosophy papers, ranging from Formal Methods (logic, probability and set theory) to Political Philosophy to Metaphysics. I also have experience teaching secondary school students Maths.</p>
    <p>In the rest of my time, I love choral singing. I was fortunate to sing with the Choir of Merton College, Oxford, for four years as a choral scholar, and with the Choir of St John's College, Cambridge, for two years as a lay clerk. I continue to enjoy choral singing as a freelance mezzo-soprano. I'm also a long-distance runner, a bagger of Munros and Wainwrights, and a devotee of cold-water swimming at the Cambridge Lido.</p>
